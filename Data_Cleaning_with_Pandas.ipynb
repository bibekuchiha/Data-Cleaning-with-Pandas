        "A huge part of data science involves acquiring raw data and getting it into a form ready for analysis. Some have estimated that data scientists spend 80% of their time cleaning and manipulating data, and only 20% of their time actually analyzing it or building models from it.\n",
        "\n",
        "When we receive raw data, we have to do a number of things before we’re ready to analyze it, possibly including:\n",
        "\n",
        "* diagnosing the “tidiness” of the data — how much data cleaning we will have to do\n",
        "* reshaping the data — getting right rows and columns for effective analysis\n",
        "combining multiple files\n",
        "* changing the types of values — how we fix a column where numerical values are stored as strings, for example\n",
        "* dropping or filling missing values - how we deal with data that is incomplete or missing\n",
        "* manipulating strings to represent the data better\n",
